# hazardous_trees
 Quick project created at the [TreesCount! Data Jam](http://treescountdatajam.devpost.com/), presented by NYC Parks to address the challenge *How can we visualize Street Tree Census Data to improve our understanding of the urban forest and help educate New Yorkers?*

Project endevors to help NYC Parks triage addressing identified as in poor health by the [2015 Street Tree Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Blockface-Data/2cd9-59fr) as well as trees identified in disrepair via 311 calls from citizens collected in NYC OpenData's [311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) dataset.
